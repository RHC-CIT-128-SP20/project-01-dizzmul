Add your Name, CRN, and Semester Year here using unordered bullets in Markdown.

## Directions

In this project, you decide your individual programming adventure in consolation with me. You will need to design a program that utilizes the elements learned in class. This will be a challenge as there will be no demo versions and if you want unit tests, you will need to design them.

As your project is unique, you will be required to help craft your grading scale as part of the program description. This will be completed as a part of Draft 1.

## Program Description

This program will help you select which ammo type you should be using within the game Escape From Tarkov. It will determine which ammunition you will most likely need given the map, the expected armor value of your opponents, the gun you're using, and the price of the ammo. It will also factor in how much money you have overall and help you decide which ammo would be best on a budget or which will be better to buy if you have a lot of money to spend

## Rubric / Grading Scale

### Additional Grading Notes

* Programmers must have attention to detail, as a result up to __2 Points__ may be taken for not updating the student info (Name, CRN, Semester Year) in the __Markdown__ and __Python Comments__.
* Customers will not pay for programs that do not work, as a result up to __50 Points__ may be taken for programs that do not run due to syntax errors.
* Programmers tend to forget how large programs work over time, as a result up to __4 Points__ may be taken for programs that do not have a _reasonable_ amount of comments that describe key sections of code.
* Minimum of 4 or more commits made to GitHub showing incremental programming changes towards the final program (4pt)
  * 1 Commit may be for updating Student Info in the Markdown and Python File
  * 3 Commits must be for programming updates to source code
  * If a unit test is available, no changes made to the Unit Test will count towards the required commits (nor should there be any changes made to this file).
  * This is a team project, all group members must have at least one commit with code changes. Updating student info does not count.
* All programs must have your Github URL submitted in Canvas via the assignment page. Unsubmitted Github repos will receive __0 Points__.
* Programs that have been submitted and received a grade will not be regraded, unless the instructor makes a request for changes.
* If a program is eligible for regrading, it is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor when the program is ready for regrading.
